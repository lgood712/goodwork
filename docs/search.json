I’m a practical and optimistic tech professional.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ve had the pleasure of working in a start-up incubator, for mid-sized companies, and on massive-scale products, such as Instagram and Facebook while at Meta.\nI’ve supported a variety of products and companies in strategy, operations, data analytics, and product management. I enjoy problem-solving, delivering value to people, and leading complex products and projects. Check out my resume here.\nOutside of work, I enjoy basketball and volleyball, reading, crossword puzzles, camping and hiking, and continued learning. I try to record some of my coursework, projects, and other exploits on the Projects page of this site.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
